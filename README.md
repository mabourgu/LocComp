This repository contains the matlab code to assess location differences between functional neuroimaging maps as described in Bourguignon et al. Neuroimage “Contrasting functional imaging parametric maps: The mislocation problem and alternative solutions”. The paper is openly accessible online: http://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S1053811917310558

To get started, open demo_script.m in matlab and follow the instructions therein.

A exemplary dataset on which to try the code can be downloaded from the OSF platform: https://osf.io/ue6ws/
